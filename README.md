# ðŸš§ wip.

I have created a working MVP for ibgib that shows some of the potential for the
ibgib architecture:

* try it out
  * https://ibgib.space
* `ionic-gib`: https://github.com/wraiford/ibgib/tree/v0.2.729/ionic-gib
  * pre-refactored MVP codebase on GitHub
* `ts-gib`: https://gitlab.com/ibgib/ts-gib/-/tree/master
  * base ibgib protocol graphing substrate lib on GitLab
* `core-gib`: https://gitlab.com/ibgib/core-gib
  * engine driving lowest layer of ibgib-specific code

# nd-gib

not 2d, not 3d, not even 4d...n-dimensional ibgib
